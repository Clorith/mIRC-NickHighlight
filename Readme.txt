NickHighlight v4 by Marius (funman)

Installation:

Extract all files to any directorie, make sure to keep foldernames.
Make sure the folder "DLL" in the same directorie as NickHighlight.mrc,
then open mIRC and type: /load -rs <dir>\NickHighlight.mrc
	(Alternatively, try the following: //load -rs $findfile(C:,NickHighlight.mrc,1) )

If you get prompted about running the script, select "Yes"
Now just rightclick and select "NickHighlight" in the popup menu.



Explanation:

After installation, open NickHighlight and then go to options.
In options you will have to select the states it should respons in, this means
if mIRC is minimized, maximized etc.

You will also get to select if you want a beeping sound whenever your nick is
mentioned, and if the script should go ontop of any other programs running.
Also, you will have to set the words and nicknames it is suposed to react with

If you check the "Backup" box, whenever you clear your NickHighlight history,
a backup is created (it will be overwritten the next time you clear the file),
this means it might take a short while to clear the NickHighlight history.

The ignore system works by you enter entering a nickname or a channel
(remember to use the # prefix on channels!!), as well as the word 'NOTICE'
if you wish to not highlight notices.

The listing system works so you either click "List All" and all highlights are shown
of you can use "List X" and you will be prompted for how many to list.
Example: 7-13
This will list highlight 7 to 13, including 7 and 13
Example 2: 5
This will list highlight 1-5, including 1 and 5
When attempting to list all quotes, you will be prompted to make sure you wish to list
them all if you have 100 or more highlights.

The rest is pretty selfexplaining =)
